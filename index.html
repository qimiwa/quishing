        <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> this is a static site that i've created to inform you all about qr phishing, colloquially known as quishing.</p>
        <h2 style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> so what exactly is phishing? </h2>
        <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> it's what evil fishermen do when they wanna make money MWHEHEHHEHWE</p>
        <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> phishing – pronounced as "fishing" – is a way <s>cybercriminals</s> scammers trick targets into giving them their personal information.
            these scammers send the targets fraudulent emails or text messages, often pretending to be reputable and prominent organizations.
            these scammers would often try to steal your credit card details, passwords, login information, and other sensitive material. it could result in you
            going broke or someone impersonating you, which is uhhhh very scary 😰
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> erm actually, i came here to read about quishing 🤓</h2>
        <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> fine. i'm assuming all of you guys know what a qr code is. y'all are not in grandmother's age range 💀</p>
        <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> so yeah, quishing is basically a form of phishing, but using qr codes as a means to steal your personal information,
            or to download weird shit like something that rhymes with corn. these scammers take advantage of the harmless appearance
            of qr codes to get people to scan it -> and the qr code can link to malicious websites that look really legit 🥶
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> so how do i not get quished?</h2>
        <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> well, for starters, don't scan random qr codes 😑 </p>
        <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> also, make sure to verify the link and the destination, some links might look very realistic and 
            scammers alter the address on websites in subtle ways. for more information on recognizing qr phishing, please visit
